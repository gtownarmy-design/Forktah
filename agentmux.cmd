REM agentmux - Windows entry point. Forwards to the WSL harness.
REM
REM Backslashes do not survive the Windows -> wsl.exe argv hand-off reliably,
REM so each argument is re-quoted here, and any argument that looks like a
REM drive-letter path (C:\foo) is rewritten to forward slashes (C:/foo).
REM Both Windows and the harness accept either form. Non-path arguments pass
REM through untouched, so prompt text keeps its backslashes.

REM   agentmux spawn rev --cli codex --cwd C:\path\to\repo
REM   agentmux ask rev "what does modbus-forge do?"

REM The launcher is whatever install.sh wrote on the WSL user's own PATH, found by a
REM login shell - not a path with one person's home directory in it. --exec hands the
REM arguments to bash as argv, so no second shell re-splits or expands them.
REM CCC_WSL_DISTRO picks the distribution (default Ubuntu).
if not defined CCC_WSL_DISTRO set "CCC_WSL_DISTRO=Ubuntu"
REM OUT holds embedded quotes, so test with "if defined" - a string compare
REM against %OUT% would break batch parsing.
if defined OUT goto withargs
wsl.exe -d %CCC_WSL_DISTRO% --exec bash -lc "exec agentmux \"$@\"" agentmux
