# The idle-agent timeout. Run from the repo root:
#   bash <(tr -d '\r' < dashboard/test_idle.sh)
#
# WHAT IT GUARDS. An agent nobody is using still holds a CLI process, a provider
# session and - when spawned unrestricted - a shell with the approval bypass off.
# The timeout closes those. The risk is the timeout closing something that IS in
# use, so most of what follows is about the cases where it must keep its hands off:
# an attached session, a session that produced output a minute ago, and a tmux that
# cannot be queried at all.
#
# The selection is tested against a FIXTURE rather than a live tmux server, so it
# runs anywhere and covers boundaries (exactly at the limit, one second under) that
# a real server cannot be posed into.
