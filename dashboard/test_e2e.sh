#   bash <(tr -d '\r' < dashboard/test_e2e.sh)
#
# WHAT IT BRINGS UP, AND WHY NONE OF IT TOUCHES YOURS. A dashboard of its own on an
# ephemeral port with a throwaway AGENTMUX_HOME, plus a stub MQTT broker on another
# ephemeral port. It never binds 8787, never reads your cc.db, and never needs the
# suite lock, so it can run while your own dashboard is up.
#
# That is only possible because the write guard derives its allowed origin from the
# port the server actually bound (Handler.allowed_origins). While that was the
# literal string "http://127.0.0.1:8787", every write from any other port was
# refused, so the only way to test the write paths in a browser was to take the
# operator's port away from them.
#
# PLAYWRIGHT IS NOT VENDORED. This repo has no package.json and no node_modules, so
# rather than add one, the browser driver is discovered: $PLAYWRIGHT_DIR if you set
# it, otherwise whatever `npx @playwright/mcp` already unpacked into the npm cache.
# If neither is there the suite SKIPS with the command to fix it, because a browser
# test that silently passes without a browser is worse than no browser test.
