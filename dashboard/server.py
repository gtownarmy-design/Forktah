    """Turn `capture-pane -p -e` output into bytes a terminal renders correctly.

    THE BUG THIS FIXES. capture-pane separates pane rows with a bare LF. A terminal
    treats LF as "down one row", NOT "down one row and back to column 1" — that second
    part is what CR does. The dashboard's terminals are built with convertEol: false,
    deliberately, because the live log stream carries real CRLF from the agent and
    converting it would corrupt that. So each snapshot row was starting at whatever
    column the previous row ended on, producing a staircase of fragments: a line would
    run off the right edge, wrap, and leave orphaned tails like "ng to read" and
    "ine 08" down the left. That is the "lines are gapped, not streaming properly"
    symptom, and it was in the snapshot only — appended log bytes always rendered fine.

    Normalise to CRLF so every row starts at column 1. Existing CRLF is collapsed first
    so nothing is doubled.

    Autowrap is also disabled around the payload: capture-pane emits exactly one line
    per pane row, and if any row reaches the last column the terminal would wrap it and
    push every subsequent row down by one, so the last rows would fall off the bottom.
    With DECAWM off, a full-width row stays on its own row. It is restored afterwards
    because the live agent output that follows genuinely needs wrapping.

        """GET /api/stream-all — every agent's output over ONE SSE connection.

        WHY THIS EXISTS. A browser allows only ~6 concurrent HTTP/1.1 connections per
        host (6 in Firefox by default), and an SSE stream holds one open indefinitely. With
        seven panes the seventh could never connect, so two panes traded places about once
        a second, each showing "disconnected — retrying" half the time. Measured: the two
        alternated perfectly complementarily, and closing one pane's stream simply moved
        the problem to whichever pane reconnected last.

        No amount of server-side tuning fixes that — the limit is in the browser. So all
        agents share one connection and every frame names its agent:

            event: snapshot   data: {"agent": "build", "b64": "..."}
            event: chunk      data: {"agent": "build", "b64": "..."}
            event: gone       data: {"agent": "build"}

        The per-agent endpoint is kept: it is what the tests exercise, and it is still the
        right thing for a single pane.
