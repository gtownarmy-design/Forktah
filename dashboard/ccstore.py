# One chronological stream over everything the harness knows, because the state was
# spread across five places that each had to be visited separately: agent panes, the
# queue, the journal, the resource probes and the courier's dead letters. A fault in
# any of them was only visible if you happened to be looking at that one.
#
# Entries are NORMALISED here rather than in the frontend, so a new source is a server
# change and every client agrees on the shape:
#
#   at        ISO timestamp, the sort key
#   source    which subsystem reported it
#   severity  info | warn | error
#   who       the agent or component, or "" when it is not about one
#   text      one line, already truncated
#   ref       optional correlation id (job, ticket, resource)
#
# The severity of a chatter message is derived from its kind, not guessed from its
# text: `error` is an error, `finding` and `blocked` are warnings, everything else is
# information. Guessing from wording is how a message saying "no errors found" ends up
# coloured red.

    THE SOURCES DO NOT AGREE ON A FORMAT, and the feed sorts on this field:

        journal   2026-09-23T02:11:57+00:00    UTC, colon in the offset
        agents    2026-09-22T21:59:46-05:00    local, colon in the offset
        chatter   2026-09-22T21:13:08-0500     local, NO colon

    The first two are the same instant as the third, but a string sort puts the UTC
    one an hour and a half earlier - so a merged feed interleaves wrongly and the
    newest line is not at the bottom. Python's fromisoformat handles the bare -0500
    form from 3.11, but this also accepts Z and falls back rather than raising,
    because one unparseable row must not cost the whole feed.
